AUDIO SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
========================

The music isn't playing because there's no actual audio file yet.

TO ADD YOUR MUSIC:
1. Place your MP3 file in this folder and name it "placeholder.mp3"
2. OR rename your file to "placeholder.mp3" and replace the existing empty file
3. Refresh the page and click "Play Music"

RECOMMENDED:
- File size: Keep under 5MB for faster loading
- Format: MP3, WAV, or OGG
- Bitrate: 128-192kbps is usually sufficient

ALTERNATIVE:
If you want to use a different filename, update the path in:
src/components/Navigation.tsx (line 23)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- Check browser console (F12) for error messages
- Ensure file is not corrupted
- Try a different audio format
- Make sure file is actually in the public/audio/ folder
