GIFT IMAGE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
=============================

To add your special photo to the gift box:

1. Place your image file in this folder
2. Name it "gift-photo.jpg" (or .png, .jpeg)
3. Refresh the page and click the gift

RECOMMENDED:
- File size: Under 2MB for faster loading
- Format: JPG, PNG, or JPEG
- Dimensions: Square aspect ratio works best (e.g., 400x400px)
- Content: A special photo of you, a couple photo, or meaningful image

ALTERNATIVE:
If you want to use a different filename, update the image path in:
src/components/Slide.tsx (around line 140)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- Make sure the file is actually in the public/images/ folder
- Check that the filename matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Try a different image format if it doesn't load
